Work day scheduler


About:

 This Work day scheduler was created by student Maximos Sarmpas to show the result of the learned topics covered in practice. Its a simple scheduler application that allows the user to save some events for each hour of the day.


The code was written following all Acceptance Criteria.

THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
